            "data": "The European Union has agreed to delay by a year the introduction of new rules to ban the sale of products that lead to massive deforestationnBRUSSELS -- The European Union agreed to delay by a year the introduction of new rules to ban the sale of products that lead to massive deforestation, caving in to demands from several producer nations from across the globe and domestic opposition within the 27-nation bloc. nOfficials said Wednesday that the EU member states, the EU parliament and the executive Commission reached an agreement in principle following weeks of haggling whether the initial rules would have to be watered down even further than the simple delay by one year. Originally, it was supposed to kick in this month. nThe deforestation law is aimed at preserving forests on a global scale by only allowing forest-related products that are sustainable and do not involve the degradation of forests. It applies to things like cocoa, coffee, soy, cattle, palm oil, rubber, wood and products made from them. Deforestation is the second-biggest source of carbon emissions after fossil fuels. nThe lead negotiator among the different EU institutions, Christine Schneider, called the delay to implement nature protection rules “a victory,” adding it would give foresters and farmers protection from “excessive bureaucracy.” nEnvironmentalists immediately criticized the move. n“With our planets forests destroyed further every day, we cannot afford delays to much-needed environmental protection laws like the EUs anti-deforestation legislation,' said said Giulia Bondi of the Global Witness group. .nOfficials from leading exporters of affected commodities — including Brazil, Indonesia and the Ivory Coast — fear the regulation could act as a trade barrier, hit small farmers and disrupt supply chains. n Under the deal, the rules are now scheduled to start Dec. 30, 2025, for large companies, and June 30, 2026, for small companies. The different EU institutions will still have to individually approve the deal but since they agreed on the measures, this is likely to be a formality. nIn offering to delay the regulation by a year, the EU Commission has said it heeded the complaints of several global partners about their state of preparedness for the rules. nSome EU governments, including in Austria and Germany, have also sought to water down the regulation or delay its introduction.nWith the delay, some governments sought to add more measures that would weaken the original rules and allow for more exemptions. Even if that was not agreed to in the current deal, Schneider said that the commission had “committed itself to updating the Deforestation Law within a year.” nGreenpeace has said that the extension would condemn the worlds forests to another year of destruction. It noted a U.N. finding that an area of forest about the size of Portugal is cut down worldwide each year.n'Instead of rolling back its environmental agenda, the EU needs to keep its commitments and show leadership to tackle the climate emergency,” said Bondi. n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

But in October, following complaints from countries both within and outside the EU, the European Commission proposed postponing the implementation by 12 months. xa0nnEU lawmakers then not only voted in favor of the delayxa0but also to dilute the conditions of the legislation by reducing the checks proposed within.nNegotiators for the blocs governments and lawmakers have now agreed on a compromise that does indeed endorse the delayxa0but does not water down the regulations original terms.nnSpeaking after the agreement was struck, lead negotiator among the different EU institutions Christine Schneider said 'we promised and we have delivered.' The postponement, she added 'means businesses, foresters, farmers and authorities will have an additional year to prepare.'nnGiulia Bondi, campainger with international investigative nonprofit Global Witness said that ongoing destruction of forests means 'we cannot afford delays to much-needed environmental protection laws like the EU's anti-deforestation legislation.'xa0nAnalysis shows that in 2023, the world lostxa0some 37,000xa0square kilometers (14,000 square miles) of tropical forest. That's an area nearly equivalent in size to Switzerland.n'We are facing a global emergency,'xa0said Anna Cavazzini, a member of the European Parliament for Germany's Green party. 'I simply find it irresponsible to delay this law by another year in this situation,'xa0she said ahead of the parliament'sxa0original decision.xa0nThe year-longxa0delay could equate to additional global forest loss of about 2,300 square kilometers, according to EU studies.nAgriculture and environment ministers, as well as the public, were involved in drafting the original law.xa0Butxa0after it was passed, several agriculture ministries — including those of Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden — began callingxa0for its implementation to be postponed.xa0nReasons given included businesses not being ready for implementation because of an inadequate benchmarking system.n'It seems that especially some of the European member states have not done their homework in preparing their stakeholders, their industry associations, their Chambers of Commerce for this law in time,'xa0said Nicole Polsterer, a sustainable consumption and production campaigner at Fern, a Brussels-based international forest protection NGO ahead of the parliamentary vote.nPolsterer was closely involved in shaping the EU deforestation regulation and said the requirements did 'not go substantially beyond the already-applied EU timber regulation,' meaningxa0they were not a argument for postponing the law.nA more understandable argument, Polsterer added, is that the European Commission was supposed to help countries implement the regulation by providing digital tools. These would helpxa0companies upload due diligence statements orxa0showxa0whether countries have a high, medium or low deforestation risk. But such tools were not fully operational by the time the EU came to vote.n'And now it is indeed a bit late for some companies to prepare themselves for the new law,' Polsterer said, adding that there arexa0'other solutions to this problem' besides delaying the rollout altogether.xa0nSchneider said the delay gave time to 'complete the online platform and the risk categorisation in six months, ensuring more predictability across the supply chain.'nThe compromise agreement contains a provision for an 'emergency break' should thexa0online system for companies not be fully operational by end-December 2025 or if the country classification is not published at least six months beforehand.nThough some industry groups, including the European Timber Trade Federation and the European Livestock and Meat Trades Union, as well as big US wood companies, claimed they could notxa0have met the EUDR's requirements in time, others are ready to go.xa0nGhana and Ivory Coast are the world's leading cocoa producers, and Europe is their largest market.nIvory Coast has set up electronic ID cards for farmers that help track beans from farms to their export ports and allowxa0them to access e-payments, while also guaranteeing growers a price for their produce in light of the new EU regulation.nGhana has mapped all the cocoa in the country andxa0established an end-to-end traceability system intended to reduce compliance costs of smallholders. Andxa0the project has been successfully piloted.nBefore November's vote,xa0a group of 120 Ghanaian and Ivorian civil society and farmer organizations appealed toxa0EU decision-makersxa0to express their deep concerns about effortsxa0to delay the law.nSome giants in the cocoa and chocolate sector — including Nestle, Mars Wrigley and Ferrero — also defendedxa0the law and opposed postponing.n'This would only serve to increase uncertainty and jeopardize the significant investments our member companies have made in preparing for its application,'xa0they wrote in an open letter at the time.nAnd Polsterer agreed, saying businesses such as Michelin hadxa0already invested millions into the new systems to be able to comply with the law by the end of 2024 and had offered special contracts with premiums to their suppliers and that a delay in implementation would threatenxa0theirxa0competitive edge.xa0nn'I don't think this bodes well for business security and Europe's relationship with the trade partners,'xa0she said.nEdited by: Tamsin WalkernnThis article was originally published on 13.11.2024 and was updated following the vote on 14.11.2024 and to include the agreement reached about the delay on 04.12.2024.nnTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video"

Originally, it was supposed to kick in this month. nThe deforestation law is aimed at preserving forests on a global scale by only allowing forest-related products that are sustainable and do not involve the degradation of forests. It applies to things like cocoa, coffee, soy, cattle, palm oil, rubber, wood and products made from them. Deforestation is the second-biggest source of carbon emissions after fossil fuels. nThe lead negotiator among the different EU institutions, Christine Schneider, called the delay to implement nature protection rules “a victory,” adding it would give foresters and farmers protection from “excessive bureaucracy.” nEnvironmentalists immediately criticized the move. n“With our planets forests destroyed further every day, we cannot afford delays to much-needed environmental protection laws like the EUs anti-deforestation legislation,' said said Giulia Bondi of the Global Witness group. .nOfficials from leading exporters of affected commodities — including Brazil, Indonesia and the Ivory Coast — fear the regulation could act as a trade barrier, hit small farmers and disrupt supply chains. n Under the deal, the rules are now scheduled to start Dec. 30, 2025, for large companies, and June 30, 2026, for small companies. The different EU institutions will still have to individually approve the deal but since they agreed on the measures, this is likely to be a formality. nIn offering to delay the regulation by a year, the EU Commission has said it heeded the complaints of several global partners about their state of preparedness for the rules. nSome EU governments, including in Austria and Germany, have also sought to water down the regulation or delay its introduction.nWith the delay, some governments sought to add more measures that would weaken the original rules and allow for more exemptions. Even if that was not agreed to in the current deal, Schneider said that the commission had “committed itself to updating the Deforestation Law within a year.” nGreenpeace has said that the extension would condemn the worlds forests to another year of destruction. It noted a U.N. finding that an area of forest about the size of Portugal is cut down worldwide each year.n'Instead of rolling back its environmental agenda, the EU needs to keep its commitments and show leadership to tackle the climate emergency,” said Bondi. n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

            "data": "Read all the stories from Slatesxa025 Most Important American Recipes of the Past 100 Years.nWhen we initially reached out to scores of chefs, recipe writers, historians, and food luminaries for nominations for their most important American recipes of the past 100 years—Which written recipes were the most influential, pivotal, or transformative for American home cooking between 1924 and 2024?—we expected strong opinions, but we didnt anticipate the philosophical quandaries that adjudicating and assembling them would bring up.nAfter all, what or who confers “importance”? Our experts do, for one thing. But we also determined it had to do with reach and scale, with the sense that a recipe represented a clear shift in some aspect of home cooking for some significant number of Americans. “American cooking”? Rightly and necessarily a sprawling thing made by immigrants, shaped by the push and pull of assimilation, separatism, and syncretism, utterly dependent on the open migration of flavors and ideas. Last, what even is a “recipe”? There are many excellent dishes from the past century that, upon examination, are innovations rather than discrete entities recorded for replication in the kitchen. Roasted Brussels sprouts, fajitas, chili crisp, and Spam musubi were all nominated and ultimately dismissed for this reason.nRecipes carry not only ingredients and instructions (sometimes) but also family stories, regional lore, cultural values, evolutions in technology and free time, and, of course, taste. They track the movement of diverse peoples across borders and nutrition fads through bodies. They are both tool and knowledge, artless instruction manual and literary form. They help us celebrate, mourn, or simply get supper on the table. One of our richest inheritances, recipes are time capsules of the past and present that happen to contain something you can safely chew.nThis is what informed our list, full of little-known history and tips we will now swear by in the kitchen (and some better left in the past). Are the 25 recipes weve gathered here really the most important from a century of American braising, baking, and imbibing? Possibly! At the very least, were sure theyve profoundly and deliciously changed what Americans eat. So tie your apron, preheat your oven to 350 degrees, and stand facing the stove—its time to get cooking.nAt this point, the story of Caesar salad is no longer history but a legend, an archetypally American tale of American food. An immigrant chef, ducking Prohibition in the States, opens a restaurant just south of the California border in Tijuana and then, one day, facing a nearly bare icebox, makes a meal of the dregs: romaine, an egg, a lemon, and some Worcestershire, tossed showily before the customer to hide how threadbare the recipe actually is. The nations craftiness, defiance, ingenuity, performance, thrift, all mixed up in a huge bowl, combining to make the perfect salad. That the story has forever been contradicted (Caesars brother said he invented it) and debated (some visitors swear there were anchovies) and commercialized (by 1938 Cardini was selling the dressing in bottles) just makes it more beautifully American.nAs a girl, Julia Child visited Caesars with her parents, and years later remembered Caesar himself cracking two eggs over the enormous wooden bowl, “the greens going all creamy as the eggs flowed over them.” She phoned Caesars daughter to nail down the recipe, and the version she printed in From Julia Childs Kitchen is the closest well get to the real thing. In those days, Child wrote, “salads were considered rather exotic, definitely foreign, probably Bolshevist, and anyway, food only for sissies.” But a century later, the Caesar is a pillar of American cuisine, classic as a Cole Porter tune—forever copied, adapted, and perverted beyond recognition, just the way we like it.nFind the recipe here.nAlso recommended:xa0Nachos, Ignacio Anaya,1943 nThe story of nachos is bizarrely similar to that of Caesar salad, and just as unverifiable: Supposedly, Ignacio Anaya was maître d at the Victory Club in Piedras Negras, Mexico, when a group of officers wives from a nearby U.S. Air Force base crossed the border to eat at the club. Unable to find a cook, Ignacio—“Nacho”—melted some colby cheese over tortilla chips, decked the appetizer with pickled jalapeños, and made history. Whether the stories are apocryphal or not, its fascinating to compare the legend of Caesar, who bottled his dressing and launched a business empire, and Nacho, who tried to claim ownership 17 years after that fateful improvisation only to be told by a lawyer to give it up—his inventionxa0might as well be in the public domain.nThe Toll House cookie started out very different from the pillowy treat we know today. In Ruth Wakefields original recipe, intended to accompany ice cream at her Toll House Inn outside Boston, the cookies were tiny—each cookie comprised a mere half-teaspoon of dough—well browned, and shatteringly crispy. There was no such thing yet as a chocolate chip, so Wakefield chopped Nestlé bars into tiny pieces. And she included nuts—blasphemy!n“Before she developed the recipe, there were butter cookies and chocolate cookies, but nobody—nobody!—had mixed small pieces of chocolate into a butter-based cookie batter,” said culinary historian Laura Shapiro, author of What She Ate. “Nobody had bitten into a cookie and encountered an actual piece of chocolate, not melted and dispersed but the real thing, yet in miniature so you also got the surrounding sense of butter and sugar to complete the experience.”n“There exists no recipe more important to the United States baking legacy than the chocolate chip cookie,” said YouTube baker B. Dylan Hollis, author of Baking Yesteryear, and Wakefields stands as a storied progenitor. Legends about her accidentally spilling chocolate bits into cookie dough, or improvising the cookies because shed run out of other ingredients, are almost surely hokum, Carolyn Wyman explained in The Great American Chocolate Chip Cookie Book. Wakefield ruled her kitchen with an iron fist, and the Toll House was no shoestring establishment—it was an enormously successful culinary megaplex, employing 100 people, that served movie stars and Kennedys.nOnce Nestlé figured out why sales of their semisweet chocolate bars were up 500 percent in New England, the company licensed the Toll House name and printed the recipe on their packaging. Gradually the cookies got bigger, softer, and more standardized, with manufactured bags of individual chocolate chips devised to make everything easier. The nuts disappeared during World War II so families sending cookies overseas didnt have to worry about the cookies spoiling in the mail. Soon Toll House ceased to mean any particular cookie and simply became synonymous with chocolate chip. (A federal judge confirmed this point by ruling against Nestlé when they sued the family who bought the Toll House restaurant from Wakefield.) Though the Toll House burned down on New Years Eve 1984, the cookies remain. “Even when a chocolate chip cookie isnt the greatest cookie Ive ever had, its still great,” said podcaster and home cook Hrishikesh Hirway. “So, thank you to Ruth Wakefield for inventing something that is so ubiquitous and so loved that its invention seems unfathomable.”nFind the recipe here.nAlso recommended: Korova Cookies/World Peace Cookies, Pierre Hermé and Dorie Greenspan,2002n“I dont feel that Im tooting my own horn here because all I did was change the name of the genius Parisian pastry chef Pierre Hermés creation. The cookie is a simple cocoa shortbread chock-full of chopped dark chocolate. But the reason I think the cookie was revolutionary is the salt. Today, we salt everything—its not unusual to find cookies with flaky salt scattered across the top. But when Pierre gave me the recipe in 1999 or 2000, the fact that you could taste the salt in each bite was startling. I think its lovely that people are still surprised by the cookie today. Because salt is a commonplace now, they might not know why they want to go back for seconds, but it doesnt matter—they do.” —Dorie Greenspan, author of Baking With Dorien“This is when you really have to cook in Chinese,” wrote Buwei Yang Chao in the first great Chinese cookbook published in America. The Chinese term for a traditional cooking technique, chao, “cannot be accurately translated into English. Roughly speaking, chao may be defined as a big-fire-shallow-fat-continual-stirring-quick-frying of cut-up material with wet seasoning. We shall call it ‘stir-fry. ” Buwei, a doctor and birth control advocate, wrote How to Cook and Eat in Chinese in her first language; her daughter Rulan, a Harvard graduate student, translated it into English; her husband Yuenren, a linguistics professor, made his own alterations and suggestions. Together they made the perfect team not only to write useful recipes but, as the historian Anne Mendelson wrote in Chow Chop Suey: Food and the Chinese American Journey, to translate “a cuisine across incredible cultural and language gaps.”nThis recipe, like all the books recipes for stir-fry—a term the Chaos invented—doesnt ask cooks to use a wok (nobody owned one, and most American stoves couldnt even accommodate them) or then-hard-to-find ingredients. It radiates good humor and, as Mendelson writes, “delight in teaching something supremely difficult to be taught”—right down to Buweis admonition to cut the pork very, very thin. “This needs a lot of patience and skill,” she writes, “but most Chinese wives have them.” How to Cook and Eat in Chinese was reprinted into the 1980s and “changed the way we eat,” said Lan Lam of Cooks Illustrated and Americas Test Kitchen. “Weve since embraced and adapted this versatile method.”nFind the recipe here.nAlso recommended: Stir-Fried Cumin Beef, Lan Lam,2020nThis recent Americas Test Kitchen favorite incorporates a clever baking-soda hack to keep the beef tender, and is accompanied by a fantastic ATK-style explainer as to how, scientifically, stir-frying works. Said ATKs Dan Souza: “A few nudges in a hot wok are all it takes to fill the kitchen with cumins earthy bouquet, sear the beef and thinly sliced onion, thicken the umami-rich sauce, and put a fan-favorite dinner on the table.”nWhile we may take for granted the sophisticated cocktail menus now on offer at higher-end restaurants and bars, this abundance is relatively recent. After Prohibition and World War II halted Americas martini- and Manhattan-rich halcyon years, there came a period that cocktail historians refer to as the Dark Ages, which ran from the 1950s into the 90s. To emerge from that benighted fruit-juice-and-cheap-vodka malaise required an archeological excavation of the past—like the rediscovery of Greek mathematics during the Renaissance, only with jigger measures instead of geometric proofs. Yumi Araki, managing producer of Americas Test Kitchens 100 Proof podcast series, noted that many bartenders around the turn of the millennium were inspired by the recipes in Ted Sauciers 1951 book Bottoms Up. “They pored through the book,” Araki said, “and helped bring classic cocktails back to the bars that paved the way for our modern cocktail revival.”nSauciers book is a fascinating document, a catalog of some 200 cocktail recipes served at New Yorks Waldorf Astoria hotel, where Saucier worked as a publicist. Its important because, as Araki pointed out, “many of the recipes are from before 1931, before Prohibition in America wiped out a lot of knowledge about drinks from the golden age of cocktails.”nOne of these nearly forgotten classics—the Last Word, which originated at the Detroit Athletic Club in the 1910s—caught the eye of a Seattle bartender named Murray Stenson. The cocktail features green Chartreuse, a somewhat obscure liqueur invented by monks in southeastern France, along with equal amounts of gin, maraschino liqueur, and lime juice. “The simplicity of the formula betrays the complexity of its taste,” Araki said, and Stensons revival repopularized the drink to the extent that representatives from Chartreuse eventually visited the bartender to thank him. “I am eternally grateful to this Last Word recipe,” Araki said, speaking for all of us, “as it has a lot to do with why were able to get a great, well-balanced cocktail at most dining and drinking establishments today.” The cocktails pioneering use of four ingredients in equal parts became a foundation for many new classic cocktails, such as the Naked and Famous, bartender Joaquín Simós pitch-perfect mix of mezcal, lime, Aperol, and green Chartreuses calmer cousin, yellow Chartreuse.nFind the recipe here. nAlso recommended: The Cosmopolitan, Dale DeGroff,2002 nDale DeGroff did not invent the Cosmo (versions of the same idea are credited to other, earlier pioneers, most notably Toby Cecchini), but he is responsible for upgrading the drink with a flamed orange peel and popularizing it in the 1990s via his influential perch at the Rainbow Room. Origin quibbles aside, we include the Cosmo here because it represents a transitional step from the Dark Ages (cranberry juice cocktail, Roses lime) into the Craft Era (quality citron vodka, fresh juice, Cointreau)—a touch more middlebrow than the Last Word, but just as important. And thanks to the fame bestowed by Sex and the City, its the drink that may be most responsible for drawing patrons attention to the innovative offerings that DeGroff and his colleagues were shaking up around the country—an enthusiasm that would eventually translate to home bars as well.nDorcas Reilly was a supervisor in the research and development department at the Campbell Soup Company. Asked to create a simple recipe that used the companys Cream of Mushroom Soup, Reilly came up with this masterpiece of Cold War–era convenience cooking: six ingredients—all pantry staples—thrown together into a single casserole dish. “It was easy enough for any housewife to prepare, made of ubiquitous canned foods, and produced through the marriage of home economics and the food industry,” said Anna Zeide, professor of history at Virginia Tech and author of U.S. History in 15 Foods. It was both side dish and ideological weapon, representing American ingenuity, technology, and bounty.nIt wasnt until the 1960s, when Campbells began printing the recipe on soup cans, that it became a Thanksgiving sensation. This unctuous casserole, which resists all efforts to dress it up or gourmet-ize it, remains a staple of the American holiday table. (The company reports that 50 percent of all cans of Cream of Mushroom are sold between November and January.) The warm nostalgia and happiness we feel at holiday time revolves, ostensibly, around the deeply personal traditions weve established around our family members and friends, and the dishes theyve made for us (and us for them). But corporations worm their way in. Green bean casserole demonstrates “the fascinating, if problematic, role of the food industry and food marketing in shaping American food culture to its will,” said Emily Contois, media studies professor at the University of Tulsa and author of Diners, Dudes, and Diets—“not just during the midcentury heyday of convenience cuisine, but today as well.”nFind the recipe here.nAlso recommended: Garlicky Green Beans, Samin Nosrat,2017n“This masterful work successfully undoes generations of advice that have engineered Americans to intensely fear foods that are well-salted. Nosrats instructions for layering salt throughout the process—salting your water well and then salting again at the end of cooking—while cooking with a steamy sauté illustrates both the science and techniques of how to cook dense vegetables, but also presents the process in a way that makes restaurant-quality cooking accessible and possible to the home cook.” —Adam Shprintzen, food historian, Marywood Universityxa0nIf youre the kind of home cook who could recite the basic steps of a meat-based stew without a recipe—brown the protein, sauté some aromatics and seasonings, cover everything with wine and stock and let it simmer—you might not find Julia Childs recipe for what amounts to “beef and carrots in red wine with some mushrooms and pearl onions on top” all that surprising. But trust, in the canned-cooking heyday of the early 1960s, it was a revelation to most Americans. “The notion that cooking could be considered an art form which could be mastered changed the way Americans approached cooking,” said Patrick OConnell of the Inn at Little Washington in Washington, Virginia. “She gave her audience confidence. If she could do it, you could too.”nThe recipe—rediscovered yet again by many home cooks during the pandemic—is also just really damn good. “Julias recipe not only taught us how to make something authentically French, it set Americans on a path back to cooking delicious food at home from the best available ingredients,” said Todd Schulkin, the executive director of the Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy and the Culinary Arts. “Its the recipe that launched the American food revolution.”nThe bourguignons success isnt only responsible for why you can be so brash with your braises in 2024. In many ways, we have Child to thank for the boom in cookbooks and food writing thats made American cuisine so vibrant in the decades since. Sara B. Franklin, author of a recent biography of cookbook editor Judith Jones, recounted that when Jones initially encountered the seminal Mastering the Art of French Cooking, she took it home and cooked the Boeuf Bourguignon first. “Judith was amazed at the precision of the recipes instructions, as well as the result,” Franklin said. “This is the recipe that sold Judith on the manuscript, and gave her the guts to find a way to work around the existing hierarchies and sexism of the publishing industry, and to push against the prevailing attitude that cookbooks were beneath literary publishers.”nFind the recipe here. nAlso recommended: Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnsons Recipe for Pedernales River Chili, Zephyr Wright, ca. 1963nJust as a famous chef like Child can shine a light on a recipe, so can the famous person who eats it. Another kind of beef stew was also attaining notoriety in the 1960s: Texas chili, thanks to President Lyndon Johnson, who replaced Jackie Kennedys French chef with his own household cook, Zephyr Wright. News articles at the time made much of the Johnsons eating down-home specialties like chili in the White House, and soon the East Wing started sending out postcards featuring Lady Birds chili recipe—in actuality, a dish developed by Wright, a Black woman born in Marshall, Texas. Wright is often credited with strengthening LBJs support for civil rights by sharing experiences of Jim Crow; indeed, the Johnsons and Wrights had occasion to drive together from Texas to Washington (Zephyrs husband was LBJs chauffeur), and the Johnsons saw that while they slept in hotels in the segregated South, the Wrights often had to sleep in the car. After Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act into law, he gave Wright the pen.nWhen Rose Previte, the owner of Michelin-starred D.C. restaurant Maydān, thinks about the recipes that were important to her as a child in Ohio, she thinks of the Green Book. “If youre Lebanese American, you grew up with church cookbooks,” she said. “Your cousins or aunts would bring them back from a Saint George church somewhere.” The Green Book was a spiral-bound collection of recipes from 1966 titled Syrian-Lebanese Cookbook, by the Shums il Bir Club, a charitable organization affiliated with the Saint George Orthodox Cathedral in Charleston, West Virginia.nThe church cookbooks collected recipes, yes. But they were even more important as a kind of community totem, a way of building connections across the diaspora and transmitting cultural knowledge across generations. “Instead of teaching us to speak Arabic,” Previte said, “the language my mom passed on was food. She basically taught us who we were and where we came from through cooking together.”nPrevites experience with a community cookbook is particular to her, but it isnt unique. The Black church cookbook, the Minnesota Lutheran casserole collection, the kosher temple cookbook (the New York Public Librarys collection includes one titled Too Good to Passover): All these books were crucial ways for specific populations to maintain community ties and share traditions with children. As those children got older, they took what they learned from those cookbooks and made something new. “Maydān was built off of grandma cooking,” Previte said. Her restaurant, the food she cooks, and her Lebanese American identity all are intricately connected to this humble spiral-bound book written by the church ladies, the matriarchs, who were determined to preserve their culture in a country that demanded assimilation.nThe Green Books recipe for baklawa echoes in Prevites memory decades later. Though many of the mothers who bought the books already knew how to make, say, hummus or baba ghanouj, baklawa was special-occasion food with finicky, time-consuming requirements, so when a wedding rolled around her mom would open up the Green Book and put Rose to work. “There was storytelling happening while you buttered every sheet of phyllo,” she said. “This seemed to happen more over baklawa than other dishes, because the dish takes hours, and because it invokes memory of holidays and celebrations.” Using her moms handwritten addenda, Previte adapted the Shums il Bir ladies baklawa recipe in her own cookbook, adding more orange-blossom water and making the simple syrup less sweet. “Also, my family doesnt often make our own dough, and we encourage others to buy it, too,” she said.nFind the original Shums il Bir recipe, and Rose Prevites updated baklawa, here.nAlso recommended: Kale, Turnip, Mustard, Collard, Rape, and Watercress Greens,xa0Ruth L. Gaskins,1968n“There is something special that every Negro knows that I can only call ‘the Negro welcome, ” Ruth Gaskins wrote in her community cookbook, A Good Heart and a Light Hand. “If I feel like seeing a friend, Ill go, and if its meal time, Ill draw up a chair and eat.” Gaskins long-out-of-print book, which desperately needs to be reissued by some enterprising academic press, is a snapshot of mid-60s Black Alexandria, Virginia: their food, their friendships, their families, and their faith. Her recipe for greens is simple and direct, stressing that many greens can still be found growing wild. Like all the recipes in the book, it was written with input from all the kitchens of Gaskins community, and the book itself benefited local Black charities. In its good humor, its rigorous research, and its community spirit, the book “reflects how African Americans used food to aid in the work of racial uplift,” said Psyche Williams-Forson, a food historian and the author of Eating While Black.nStarting in 1949, the Pillsbury Bake-Off was a sensation, inviting the nations home cooks to submit their best recipes—using Pillsbury flour, of course—for a cash prize and national acclaim. The Tunnel of Fudge, from Mrs. C.J. Helfrich of Houston, was merely the runner-up in the 66 competition, but it went proto-viral, thanks to a thick, fudgy core that runs through the center of the cake, achieved through Helfrichs canny use of powdered frosting mix. Nordic Ware, the company that made Bundt pans, had considered discontinuing the unpopular model—until the Tunnel of Fudge. “Demand for the pan skyrocketed,” New York Times food writer Kim Severson said. Soon, they were manufacturing 30,000 pans a day.n“The Tunnel of Fudge reflects the shift to mixes and convenience foods in postwar food preparation,” said Sarah Elvins, a food historian at the University of Manitoba. Companies pitched housewives on “up-to-dated, streamlined, shortcutted” tricks and tips generated by their robust R&D departments. These days, as home cooks focus on whole foods and natural ingredients, the convenience era of the 1960s seems misguided. (Have you tried a TV dinner recently?) But the Tunnel of Fudge lives on in the cultural memory, even after Pillsbury discontinued the frosting mix that makes that magical center. Legions of food bloggers, home cooks, and even Americas Test Kitchen have attempted to re-create this midcentury masterpiece of baking; few have succeeded.

Butter, bittersweet chocolate, eggs, yolks, sugar, and a little flour—thats it. You can make the batter ahead of time and bake the cakes in seven minutes right in front of your family and friends, and they are amazed how good it is,” said Ricky Moore, the chef at Saltbox Seafood Joint in Durham, North Carolina.n“How did Americans become experts at writing cookbooks on Mexican food?” asks Gustavo Arellano in his book Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America. The two biggest names in Mexican home cooking remain, to this day, Diana Kennedy and Rick Bayless—excellent chefs both, and devoted to preserving traditional Mexican foodways, but each hung up on certain received ideas of “authenticity” that have a lot to do with their own backgrounds and blind spots. “The sad fact,” Arellano told us, “is America has never listened to Mexican American kitchen voices when it comes to Mexican food for home.”nTake this recipe by Josefina Velázquez de León, which represents the precise midpoint of Mexican cookings journey into the mainstream American marketplace. The celebrity chef Velázquez, said the Mexican food historian Denise Favela, “wasnt just a cookbook writer—she was an ethnographer, a historian, a Mexican culinary diplomat.” She traveled her country during perilous times, chronicling the home cooking of every region of Mexico, publishing over 130 Spanish-language cookbooks. And everywhere she went, there were enchiladas. “No matter what region you visit in Mexico, they have their own rendition,” said Favela. “Some have eggs, some have cinnamon, some are creamy, some are light. She documented those recipes with incredible accuracy.”nBut this recipe, published in Velázquezs only bilingual cookbook, eschews the regional particularities of the enchilada recipes shed spent decades collecting. (Colorado doesnt refer to a particular region—it just means “colored red.”) Gone are the chayotes, the pigs foot in vinegar, the fresh cream of the recipes that, for example, she chronicled in the region of Tamaulipas, on the Texas border. “These enchiladas are sort of regionless, sort of basic,” said Favela. “She was trying to speak to an audience that doesnt have the same grasp of Mexican cuisine.” Mexican Cook Book Devoted to American Homes was not a particular success. (These days copies are rare enough that when an aficionado finds one, its the kind of discovery they post to Reddit. I got the recipe from the hardworking research librarians at the University of Texas at San Antonios amazing Mexican Cookbook Collection.) Anglo readers who encountered the recipe most likely found it in Diana Kennedys 1975 Tortilla Book, which, as Kennedy noted in her introduction, drew “heavily” on Velázquezs work. (If anything, thats an understatement, though shes always given credit where credit is due.) Ironically, Kennedy knows that her Anglo American readership prized “authenticity,” so her Red Enchiladas were attributed to a region—Aguascalientes—and accompanied 19 other regionally specific enchilada recipes.nAnd yet: The recipe, like Kennedys version of it, does capture something important about what enchiladas truly were, as opposed to the way theyve been transformed by the explosion of Tex-Mex restaurant food. (Ah, that tricky notion of authenticity again.) Google an enchilada recipe these days and youll likely find a baked casserole of what are essentially tortillas, filling, and sauce. “The problem with bad enchiladas is theyre treated as if theyre lasagna,” said the chef and food writer Adán Medrano. “But theyre not. Theyre a vehicle for the flavor of the chile.” After all, he pointed out, the word itself comes from enchilar, a verb that means, literally, “to be infused with chile.” Rather than having you bake your tortillas in soupy, cheesy sauce for half an hour, all these recipes instruct the chef to dip a tortilla in a heated chile gravy just long enough to infuse it with flavor—to “chilefy” it—fill it, fry it, then eat it immediately. Thats how Mexican and Mexican American families have long eaten their enchiladas in Mexico, in the borderlands, and across the U.S., Medrano says—as chronicled by Josefina Velázquez, whose recipes may be hard to find but still tell us something important about the way foodways cross borders, eras, and cultures.nHow to classify Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl, by the actor, radio personality, anthropologist, griot, and food writer Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor? Part recipe collection, part memoir, part love note to Black food, part provocative argument about Black power, Vibration Cooking blew up the staid cookbook form and demanded that readers consider the politics of soul food. Chicken and waffles, pointed out Psyche Williams-Forson, a food historian and the author of Eating While Black: Food Shaming and Race in America, is the perfect recipe for that message. “The dish appeared after Thomas Jefferson bought waffle irons in Amsterdam,” she said. “Who was cooking for Jefferson? It wasnt him.”nA product of the Black Arts Movement, Vibration Cooking enacts its politics in its form. Recipes arrive embedded in stories of Black community, consciousness, and activism, and make no concessions to a reader coming to them from outside the culture or the movement. To read Smart-Grosvenors recipe—such as it is—for chicken and waffles is to be immersed in a long night in New York, rehearsing for a Nat White play at the Thirteenth Street Theater, dancing to the Sun Ra Arkestra with a Whos Who of the citys Black cognoscenti (“Larry and Evelyn Neal, Jocelyn, José, Hattie, Leroi and Sylvia and Bill and Cecil and Rap”), and then repairing to Wells Restaurant till 4 in the morning. The recipe, in full:nMix two cups sifted cake flour, a pinch salt and 4 teaspoons baking powder together in a bowl and add 2 cups milk. Beat and add ½ cups cold water. Beat some more and then add 1 stick melted butter. Cook on waffle iron and serve with fried chicken.nSmart-Grosvenor offered a simple recipe for waffles, assumed the reader already knew where to get fried chicken, and embedded the food itself deep within a meaningful and vibrant cultural milieu—and her own idiosyncratic personal history. “She places these foods in conversation with memory,” Williams-Forson said. “Isnt this how our memories really work? Theyre disjointed and scrambled and all over the place. Shes just like, ‘Fuck it, this is what Ima say.xa0”n“Its the recipe of our grandmothers and great-grandmothers, a holy tradition of our own,” said Helen Rosner of the New Yorker, and a brisket slow-roasted in liquid, a few vegetables, and Lipton onion soup mix is, for many American Jews, the very definition of the Passover table. Lipton started making dehydrated soup mixes in 1952, and it took no time at all for home cooks to figure out that all those dried onions, yeast extracts, and delicious glutamates could impart instant flavor to a casserole or roast. By 1964 this proto–food hack was common enough to land in the pages of The Joy of Cooking.nLipton cannily took advantage of its customers experimentation by printing recipes on its packaging, in ads, and in recipe columns: for California dip, of course, plus Lipton meatloaf, Lipton veal paprika, Lipton salmon-noodle casserole. By the early 1970s, the company was promoting its brisket recipe. This recipe, though, is unusual among the ones on this list in that it represents less the definitive way to cook the dish than it does a kind of corporate compromise, the arithmetic mean of the dozens or even hundreds of recipes already in use, each unique to the household where it was discovered, refined, and perfected.nThe simplicity of the recipe is key. Perhaps you follow the recipe on the Lipton website, or the entirely different one printed on the kosher-certified Lipton packets for sale in Jewish markets. Whether your family uses water or wine or stock or ginger ale, you mix it up with the soup mix and then drop the brisket into the pool of liquid. (Once, when a friends young son was obsessed with LeBron James, he insisted she make “LeBrisket,” using James special flavored Sprite. “It was pretty good,” she recalled.) Each time a family returns to their recipe, the cook is reminded of the ancestor who on one glorious midcentury day discovered that they didnt have to chop all those onions—that machines in a factory could do it for them. Asked Rosner: “What greater metaphor for the relief and the reinvention of the postwar years than—thanks to the mercies of the American industrialized food system and the abundance of the American supermarket—no longer needing to stand in the kitchen and weep?”nThe Vegetarian Epicure was different from other “health-food” cookbooks on the market in the 1970s. Its writer, UCLA film student Anna Thomas, intended the book to be “a delight and a celebration of life” and, inspired by editor Judith Jones, sought to pack every recipe with luxurious flavor. Her quiche recipe includes half a cup of cheese and another cup and a half of sour cream. “It was rich and filling,” said Jonathan Kauffman, author of Hippie Food: How Back-to-the-Landers, Longhairs, and Revolutionaries Changed the Way We Eat. “It wasnt like a tofu loaf or a nut burger or sprouts. It was a very different vision of vegetarian food than the dominant one in the 70s, which was macrobiotic.”nThomas book struck a chord with an eating public eager to experiment with vegetarianism but worried about flavor; quiche, which was familiar and simple and could make any vegetable beautiful—even prosaic zucchini—became a ubiquitous vegetarian staple. Maybe too ubiquitous: By the end of the decade, the dish no longer represented French cuisine but instead was synonymous with prissy, liberal herbivores. In 1982 a humor book about American masculinity spent 55 weeks on the bestseller list. Its title? Real Men Dont Eat Quiche.nFind the recipe here.nAlso recommended: Sunshine Happy Hippie Granola, Lisa Law and the Hog Farm Collective,1969n“The first Woodstock, held in August 1969, was the birthplace of Sunshine Happy Hippie Granola, which was made in the onsite kitchen and served to concertgoers. In time, to be granola, to be crunchy, became a cultural identity. Along the way, the recipe splintered into a thousand variations, which is how it remains today. Its this essential changeability that gets at what a recipe for home cooks really is: a formula that wants you to break the rules. We may not all make granola the same, but each time we pull a pan from the oven and whiff its toasty aroma, we replicate the independence hippies were claiming for themselves.” —Lola Milholland, author of Group Living and Other RecipesnThese days, some dedicated home cooks purchase whole spices from purveyors like Spicewalla, toasting and grinding at home—and the difference in flavor from the pre-ground grocery store stuff cannot be overstated. We can thank the queen of Indian cuisine for introducing this concept to America. “She was telling American cooks: ‘To hell with the sawdusty curry powder in American grocery stores, ” said Priya Krishna, restaurant critic at the New York Times and author of Indian-ish. “Make your own blends, and your food will taste so much better!” Krishna conceded that this recipe is not her go-to garam masala: “Every family seems to have its own proprietary blend.” But Madhur Jaffrey “helped Americans understand that half the battle in preparing truly exceptional Indian food that really sings, that fills the whole room with these irresistible aromas, is using whole spices.”nJaffrey was an actor—she starred in an early Merchant-Ivory film, Shakespeare Wallah—who moved to the United States in 1957. Missing the food of her childhood, shed written her mother, asking her to send recipes; by the mid-1960s, she was being profiled in the New York Times as a glamorous ambassador of Indian cuisine. She made a deal for a cookbook, but the book languished when its editors left the house; the legendary Judith Jones swept in to acquire the book and, in 1973, Knopf published An Invitation to Indian Cooking. The book takes pains to help non-Indian chefs feel intrigued, rather than intimidated, by unfamiliar ingredients, which in those days included such exotics as ginger root and cilantro. (Jones personally called gourmet grocery stores around the East Coast, urging them to stock the ingredients.) In her garam masala, we see the roots not only of Indian cooking in America, but of “mainstream” interest in the ingredients, techniques, and flavors of non-Western cuisines. Dont just think of Madhur Jaffrey when you grind your own garam masala. Think of her each time you read about a new spice or condiment from a culture outside your own and eagerly buy it to experiment in your own kitchen.nFind the recipe here.nNote: This is an updated version of the recipe. To make Jaffreys original 1973 version, replace the nutmeg with ¾ teaspoon coriander seed.nPersonal favorite: Murgh Masala, Julie Sahni,1980n“I dont know what all the white women who bought Sahnis, or Jaffreys, books were cooking with them. This is the first Indian dish I tried to make for myself, after a spotty culinary education from my Bengali grandmother and my white mother. It feels like the first thing a lot of people might turn to in a book full of perhaps unfamiliar flavors. Like, how different can chicken stew be? The spine of my copy of Classic Indian Cooking is completely cracked and stained at this page. Its the thing I make for dinner parties when I want something everyone will like, what I cook for friends recovering from surgeries and births, what I tell people about when they are thoroughly convinced Indian food is too hard for them. Its not. Indians make it every day.” —Jaya Saxena, writer at Eater and series editor for The Best American Food WritingnNo recipe was mentioned more frequently by our experts than this foolproof three-ingredient sauce, first published in Marcella Hazans Classic Italian Cook Book. “One of the godmothers of Italian home cooking,” as More Is More writer Molly Baz calls her, Hazan introduced Americans to the very idea of Italian food as cuisine. “She elevated Italian food, showing Americans that its more than Chef Boyardee and spaghetti and meatballs,” said Dan Pashman, host of the Sporkful podcast and author of Anythings Pastable.nOne reason the recipe is legendary? Its ease. “Sometimes you do not have the energy to chop an onion, or to wait for vegetables to soften before you add spices,” said Jaya Saxena, writer at Eater and series editor for The Best American Food Writing. “Sometimes you only have the energy to throw three things into a pot.” In this way the recipe was revolutionary, convenience food that wasnt space-age or mechanized but was instead a reflection of the precepts of Italian cooking going back generations. As Baz pointed out, it wasnt just about saving time—it was that simplicity could yield a purity of flavor: “A few ingredients of high quality can sometimes yield better results than a recipe packed with tons of bells and whistles.”nThose ingredients: tomatoes, an onion sliced in half, and—famously—a ton of butter. (Everyone remembers the recipe as including an entire stick, but really its a mere 5xa0tablespoons.) Sure, change it if you want. (“Its infinitely riffable,” said Baz.) Sure, use Safeway butter and whatever old can of tomatoes youve got. (“Ive never made it with fresh tomatoes, and I sort of suspect it wouldnt be as good,” confided cookbook agent Sharon Bowers.) Itll always taste delicious, and itll always give you courage that even the simplest recipe can be the basis for memorable home cooking.nFind the recipe here.nNote: Hazan calls for 2xa0cups of tomatoes, but you can just use a full, standard 28-ounce can for ease.nIf youve ever made buttermilk biscuits, the ingredients in Edna Lewis recipe will be familiar: flour, baking powder, lard. As will the fundamental method: Sift the dry, cut in the fat, form the dough with a firm but light touch. But what should stand out in the prose—and it is prose, not just bullet points—is Lewis herself, her years of experience and the collective kitchen wisdom of her community, captured in evocative lines like “It was said piercing the dough released the air while baking.”nWhere the instruction to dock the dough “was said” was in Freetown, Virginia, a community that had been founded by formerly enslaved people after the Civil War and in which Lewis grew up. It was in Freetown that she learned to cook a style of Southern food that was deeply tied to the seasons and dependent on the labor and expertise of her family and neighbors in agriculture, animal husbandry, and preservation. In The Taste of Country Cooking, published in Americas bicentennial year, Lewis—who had made a career as a chef and caterer—achieved something remarkable in putting down not only delicious recipes but the rhythms and values of the special place that had shaped her. That, and bringing, as Priya Krishna observed, “some much-needed perspective to a cooking landscape that at the time was dominated by wealthy white women.”nSpeaking of shaping: Making biscuits well can be a daunting project. Lewis offers the help and encouragement you need just when you need it: “Dust the cutter as often as needed. An added feature to your light, tender biscuits will be their straight sides.” She has faith in you, so have faith in yourself. If youre following Edna Lewis recipe, its not misplaced—just take your time, heed her advice, and in about 13 minutes, give or take, things are going to come out all right.nFind the recipe here.nPersonal favorite: Cream Biscuits, James Beard,1973n“The first thing I attempted to bake at home: a recipe found in a magazine (I forget which one) for James Beards cream biscuits. Im sure it was old, and Im also sure it wasnt the best biscuit recipe I ever had (Im a buttermilk biscuit person), but it was something I began to bake and start the process of tweaking to my specifications: adding fruit (dried or fresh), cutting into triangles for a more sconelike energy, adding cheese and scallion for something savory. At 18, this felt revolutionary, like I was creating something new each time I made a change to this ‘real recipe. While I dont know where this would rank on the ‘Important to the American Cook scale, I know it was important to me.” —Alison Roman, author of Nothing Fancy and Dining InnAs Ina Garten recounts in her recent memoir, the 1970s witnessed the heyday of the specialty food store in New York and other cities—neighborhood shops that offered well-made appetizers, entrees, desserts, and baked goods alongside house-canned and fancy imported items meant to be picked up and served at home. These were popular not least for offering working women a way out of the catch-22 of having a career while still being expected to put a quality meal on the table each night: Grab a lemon roast chicken, a side of string beans, and a plum pie, and keep it moving.nGartens Barefoot Contessa filled this role out in the Hamptons, but back in the city, there was Dean & Deluca, Zabars, and, perhaps most beloved of all, the Silver Palate on the Upper West Side. When the wildly successful Silver Palate Cookbook hit shelves in 1982, the stores unlikely star entree, Chicken Marbella—a baked chicken dish festooned with prunes, capers, green olives, and brown sugar—quickly made the jump from takeout favorite to dinner-party showstopper. Dorie Greenspan, author of Baking With Dorie, recalled a potluck supper for her sons fourth grade class to which she brought her “company dish,” Chicken Marbella—as did three other parents. For a certain generation, Marbella was the prototypical movin-on-up meal, a dish that utilized a new wave of yuppie-friendly ingredients just becoming popular, giving polish to American home cooking.nAnd it still works. “Chicken Marbella remains one of the best recipes ever written,” said Laura Shapiro, a culinary historian and author of What She Ate. “It will never fail, no matter what you do to it. You can overcook it, you can take it out of the oven hours ahead, the leftovers are delicious—nothing will ever, ever go wrong with this recipe, and everyone will always love it.”nFind the recipe here.nNote: Many argue that the cup of brown sugar in this recipe is too much for modern tastes. A generous sprinkle over the chicken achieves the desired effect.nAlthough Martha Stewart is undeniably the OG of the “domestic goddess” game (her first cookbook, Entertaining, based on her work as a fancy caterer, came out in 1982), Ina Garten is arguably the figure who made the affluent aesthetic of elegance and ease around cooking and hosting feel accessible to the masses. If Martha built a business empire and massive estate (or three) out of the domestic arts, Ina concerned herself with a more human-scale Hamptons food shop and a cozy, beachy home you could almost imagine living in (just dont look at the Zillow). Indeed, as Garten shares in her recent memoir, “earthy elegance”—captured in the Barefoot Contessa brand—is her guiding vibe. And her recipes have always maintained that sense of warm invitation and aspirational possibility (“store-bought is fine!”)—even if a 3-pound beef tenderloin and a fresh bottle of crème de cassis for the plum crunch arent actually in the budget this month.nOne recipe embodies that ethos more than any other. The food writer and author Stephanie Rosenbaum Klassen recalled being a young assistant editor and seeing the cover of Gartens first book at a trade show in 1999. “That cover ate,” she said. “It said summer. It said, Eat like youre in France. It said, You can do this.” That book was the original Barefoot Contessa Cookbook, and the dish on the cover—“two silver spoons scooping a gorgeous medley of potatoes, green beans, scallions, tuna, olives, and herbs”—was Provençal Potato Salad.nThe book sold over 100,000 copies in its first year; Garten rose to TV fame and became the household name she is now: the domestic goddess whose warm, approachable personality sells you on a lifestyle dream. “I still like to think of some young assistant photo editor in the cover meeting,” said Klassen, “pulling out that picture, of that potato salad, and saying, ‘This one. This is the one we want.xa0”nFind the recipe here.nPersonal favorite: Macaroni and Cheese, Martha Stewart,2008n“When I started to get into cooking, I decided I must learn how to make homemade baked mac and cheese. I knew the only person I could trust was Ms.xa0Martha Stewart. Using her recipe, I cooked flour in butter, added milk to the pot, seasoned it with nutmeg, and then added cheese. After taking my first bite of the finished dish, I was so proud! In the first few weeks of culinary school, we learned about the mother sauces. Sitting in class, I listened to the teacher describe béchamel, stressing how important this sauce is as a building block to many dishes. I learned if you add cheese to béchamel you make a new sauce called mornay. Thats when my light-bulb moment happened. If I added cooked pasta to a mornay, poured the mixture into a glass baking dish, and piled buttery breadcrumbs on top, I would have baked mac and cheese! Do you think Ms.xa0Martha knows?!” —Kelsey Bush, chef–owner, Bloomsday, PhiladelphianSometimes what you want to eat is not a roast chicken or a 21-ingredient potato salad. Sometimes you want pancakes, but who has a recipe for pancakes? Maybe, once upon a time, your grandma did. But these days, you know who has a recipe for pancakes, or banana bread, or lasagna?nThe internet does. So you Google “pancake recipe,” and there it is.nAs Ruby Tandoh, author of Cook as You Are, recently explained in the New Yorker, search engines have transformed how we find our recipes. “Good Old-Fashioned Pancakes,” uploaded by who-knows-who to the crowdsourced cooking site Allrecipes in 2001, epitomizes a shift in culinary knowledge that mirrors the shift in all knowledge: Much of the information that used to persist as folk wisdom, or was written in books, now is stored, cloudlike, on the internet and is thus beholden to the same vagaries of algorithmic discovery that increasingly rule our lives.n“It used to be that recipes borrowed their authority from whichever famous cook wrote them,” Tandoh told us. “Now you only need to look at the numbers: These pancakes have nearly 15,000 five-star ratings, and are the most popular dish on the Allrecipes site. Theyre probably the most-cooked pancakes in the world.” In the future, will there be only one pancake, one banana bread, one lasagna? Each one, if so, will be a triumph not of flavor, necessarily, but of a different kind of ingredient list: the perfect SEO terms to attract eyeballs, not taste buds. “Few of us have Grandmas dog-eared recipe cards lying around,” Tandoh said. “But we do have the well-trodden paths of the search engine, where the most used, most loved, most old-fashioned recipes reliably rise to the top.”nFind the recipe here.n“This is the great roast chicken recipe,” said the New Yorkers Helen Rosner. Before opening Zuni Café in 1987, Judy Rodgers was the lunch chef at Chez Panisse, Alice Waters storied proving ground for what would become known as “California cuisine.” This approach to cooking, drawing heavily on the traditions of the French, prizes the local, farm-fresh ingredients of the abundant region and treats them simply (or at least with a simple feel), such that the organic carrot or heritage pork chop itself is celebrated more than any elaboration by the chef. This philosophy is at the heart of what we now call farm-to-table, New American, or modern American cooking.nBut for all its talk of simplicity, California cuisine can be hard to pull off if youre notxa0… in California, where fig trees spill over onto the sidewalks and the farmers market boasts 17 kinds of citrus. But a good chicken—that you can get anywhere; likewise with bread, bitter lettuces, and currants (at least dried). And this recipe launches that good chicken over the moon. The reason? As Ashley Christensen, the chef of AC Restaurants, in Raleigh, North Carolina, explained, “Judy has you dry-brine the bird a day or two in advance—thats the only part that really demands patience—so you can achieve results in your own oven. Thats a technique that Judy popularized and, directly or not, taught to countless people who may not have set foot in Zunis iconic dining room.”nThe “Zuni chicken” did much to reintroduce the whole roast chicken into many Americans cooking rotation, and it inspired countless homages. Indeed, if you gaze upon the languid three pages of instructions of the original recipe and find it, well, a teeny bit complex, try this streamlined version from Americas Test Kitchen.nFind the recipe here.nIts a common belief that baking is harder than cooking because of the precision involved in measurements, temperature, and the like. But whats truly hard is breadmaking: All that rising and fermenting and gluten-structuring has been the downfall of many a home baker, long giving bread the aura of a science best left to the professionals. That is, until master baker Jim Lahey came down from the mount with a simple technique that allows just about anyone with a Dutch oven and a little patience the freedom to whip up, as Mark Bittman put it in his giddy annunciation, a “fine-bakery quality, European-style boule” that will “blow your mind,” with a burnished crust and satisfying crumb. Forget the finicky sourdough starters and the specialty equipment—with Laheys recipe, theres no need.n“No one could have predicted the impact his technique would have. Mix the dough, let it rise, bake it in a Dutch oven, and then be amazed—even first-time bakers turn out loaves with gorgeous, crackle-crisp crusts that the best pros strive to make,” said Dorie Greenspan, author of Baking With Dorie. “Every time I lift the lid and see the bread Ive made, Im astonished. Still.”nFind the recipe here.nAfter Condé Nast killed off Cooks magazine in 1989, its founder, Christopher Kimball, bought back the concept and relaunched it as Cooks Illustrated in 1993. (The magazines first executive editor was Mark Bittman.) With its hand-drawn illustrations and lack of advertising, the magazine—like the public-television show it spawned, Americas Test Kitchen—was an argument for a maximum-impact, no-B.S. approach to cooking. There was such a thing as the right recipe, according to the ATK ethos, and if you were diligent enough in your testing, you could find it.nCooks Illustrated and ATK, when combined with the simplifying of social media, spawned the food hack—“something surprising or unconventional that achieves better-than-average (or faster-than-expected, or weird, or wild, or whatever) results,” as the New Yorkers Helen Rosner put it. The reverse sear, popularized by J. Kenji López-Alt for ATK, “is probably the most famous food hack of them all.” Rather than the traditional method of cooking a steak—searing the outside to build up a crust, then roasting it until it reaches your desired doneness—the reverse sear, well, reverses it. In a very low oven, you cook the steak until a thermometer tells you its reached the precisely correct temperature, then you blast the hell out of its outside to get an instant delicious dark crust.nThe methods viral popularity and spirit of geeky experimentation “made it a gateway for a lot of people (who were, to put a point on it, mostly men) to get interested in cooking,” Rosner said. “It is basically the foundational text of the entire bro-cooking movement.” It also really works—fulfilling the promise of ATK, that if youre willing to overturn everything youve ever learned, you too can succeed at cooking, every single time.nFind the recipe here.nNote: Read López-Alts most up-to-date discussion of this recipe here.nAlso recommended: “How to Cook a Fucking Steak,” Alex Balk,2009nA crudely written, overaggressive, hilarious “recipe” that tweaked the reverse sears virality, lampooned precious food writing, and presaged the coming crisis in American masculinity.

Trust us.” The internet quickly made clear that it did not trust the Times, exploding in anger—some mock, some very sincere—that the paper would dare defile the quintessential Mexican-American dip in such a brazen way.nAs our former Slate colleague L.V. Anderson noted at the time, the backlash to the slightly sweet and starchy but otherwise fairly normal-tasting guac was so powerful that it (briefly) united the countrys political right and left wings:nThe instantly legendary social media brouhaha grew to envelop the Republican Party of Texas (which tweeted, “The @nytimes declared war on Texas when they suggested adding green peas to guacamole”) and even the president of the United States. Asked about the recipe in a Twitter chat, President Obama wrote, in fluent Twitterese, “respect the nyt, but not buying peas in guac. onions, garlic, hot peppers. classic.”nAnderson astutely pointed out the two reasons for this intense response to half a cup of peas: the threat of sneaking something “healthy” into our chips and dip, and, more seriously, the specter of culinary gentrification, of an ethnically specific food with a rich history being debased by an arguably white-coded ingredient like peas. For her part, Melissa Clark, the writer who brought the recipe to the Times from the chefs at ABC Cocina, has acknowledged that people didnt “like that we were mucking with tradition.” But she holds firm that “as a food writer, as a recipe developer, I fundamentally disagree” that theres only one proper way to make guacamole.nIt is not clear how many people actually charred the jalapeño for the green pea guac before utterly flaming the recipe online, but regardless, its mere existence shaped a whole era of discourse around issues of authenticity and cultural sensitivity in the food media. And that was just over a handful of pulses; imagine the uproar if theyd made it down the ingredient list to the [shudder] sunflower seedsxa0…nFind the recipe here.nHow will you figure out what youre going to cook tonight? Very likely, youll turn to a trusted chef. Once upon a time, youd have found that chef, who probably owned a famous restaurant, in a newspaper article, or in a cookbook on your shelf, or on a TV show on the Food Network. But thats not how trusted chefs talk to their fans anymore. Now youll find those chefs—many of whom might have zero interest in running a restaurant—on your phone: talking in a podcast, sending a newsletter to your email, posting a photo on Instagram Stories. That cook is as close to you as all your other parasocial relationships. Maybe, when you make their recipe tonight, youll post a photo and tag them.nIn the fall of 2016, food writer Helen Rosner sent out a newsletter featuring a soup recipe, a pretty basic, tasty sausage-bean-kale-Parmesan deal. The recipe was informal in tone yet written with attention to detail, reflecting, Rosner said, her desire to replicate the way she gave instructions to her kitchen-shy husband. (“While the sausage is cooking, get ready for the second round of stuff-doing.”) After becoming deeply familiar with the soup over many repeat cookings, that husband had dubbed it “Roberto.”nAnd then, in the winter of 2020, with the COVID pandemic approaching, Roberto was suddenly everywhere on Instagram. Every day, Rosner wrote, people made her soup, created variations, and posted the photos to Stories: “The recipe isnt mine anymore; Roberto has taken on a life of his own, and its thrilling.” On Instagram Rosner, like many cooks, likes to share the photos people post of her recipe to her own Stories, and so each day this autumn, as with every autumn since 2020, may have brought a new Roberto or two to your phone. Maybe youll make it for dinner tonight.nFind the recipe here.nAlso recommended: Caramelized Shallot Pasta, Alison Roman,2020nThough we chose Roberto because Rosner wrote so eloquently about what creating such a recipe, and watching it flower online, feels like, Rosner herself points out that “patient zero” for this kind of chef-to-home-cook feedback loop is “bona fide Instagram star” Alison Roman. “In the early, disorienting months of the pandemic,” Rosner said, “this terrific recipe seemed to be in every kitchen and on every Instagram account, one of the few threads holding everyones collective sanity together.”nIn the baking world, theres just about nothing more American than the cookie—especially the nostalgic classics, like chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and snickerdoodle. But whats also distinctly American—or should be, anyway—is the opening up of the old standards to the flavors and innovations of cooks and food traditions from across the globe. In 2023 the Guardian noted one such trend in the “rise of the multi-culti savory cookie,” and Eric Kims gochujang caramel cookie stood as a prime example. For the unfamiliar, gochujang is a spicy-sweet Korean chili paste typically used in savory dishes like bibimbap; here, Kim swirls it through a wide, snickerdoodle-like sugar cookie, producing a dramatic effect in both color and taste.nKim, whose first cookbook, Korean American, is a tribute to the power of this kind of culinary cultural synthesis, created the recipe for the New York Times holiday-season “Cookie Week” in 2022. Kim told the Guardian that initially, “people were really skeptical. It was as if youd said the most wild thing in the world.” But that skepticism quickly gave way to smiles—thousands of them—as the cookie caught on with home bakers. Its still one of the most popular recipes Kim has ever written, and a potent reminder that everything is better when you keep your mind, and your pantry, open to the unfamiliar.nFind the recipe here.n“Sometimes you need to eat an entire cucumber, and Im going to show you the best way to do it.” So begins Ottawa-based creator Logan Moffitts viral video from the summer of 2024 featuring the cucumber salad that took over TikTok. With over 15xa0million views, its the most famous salad in recent history, and surely the only one to cause a cucumber shortage in Iceland. What makes it so catchy? The ingredients are not particularly special: an English cucumber and some scissor-clipped scallions; a few standard East Asian condiments like soy and fish sauce, sesame oil, and a sprinkling of MSG (which has finally been cleared of the racist libel that it was unhealthy to consume). But taking a cue from the sadly forgotten McSalad Shaker, its the flashy assembly of the humble elements that sets this salad apart. Moffitt—who is now known as TikToks “cucumber guy” for his devotion to the fruit—uses a mandoline to slice the cuke into a restaurant quart container, to which he then casually adds his seasonings, finally giving all of it a good jostle. Once the juices settle, he dives right in with a pair of chopsticks, following through on his promise to demolish a whole cucumber in one sitting.nBest way to eat an entire cucumber nn          This content requires consent that you have not granted on Slate.
